This is a social media application which was developed by me during my college days.

<b>Basic Idea</b> : I wanted to create a social media application for our college, so that we can get to know each other. Due to this requirement I added the functionality to check who is using the application from which location.

In this application, there is functionality to create posts, add friends, like, comment, share, view profile and other features as well.
